# Explore generative AI with Microsoft Copilot

Generative AI describes a category of capabilities within AI that create content. People typically interact with generative AI that has been built into chat applications. One popular example of such an application is Microsoft Copilot, an AI-powered productivity tool designed to enhance your work experience by providing real-time intelligence and assistance. 

In this exercise, you will use Microsoft Copilot to generate travel plans.

> **Note**: This exercise assumes that you have a [personal Microsoft Account](https://signup.live.com) (such as an Outlook.com account).

## Use Microsoft Copilot to generate travel plans

1. In your web browser, open [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) at `https://copilot.microsoft.com`. Click on the **Sign in** button on the right hand side of the screen. Sign in using your personal Microsoft account - closing any welcome messages or offers that are displayed.

    >**Note**: You may be prompted to continue with your **Work** or  **Personal** account. Select **Personal** and sign in. 

1. Consider the following ways you can improve responses from a generative AI assistant:
    - Start with a specific goal for what you want the assistant to do
    - Iterate based on previous prompts and responses to refine the result
    - Provide a source to ground the response in a specific scope of information
    - Add context to maximize response appropriateness and relevance
    - Set clear expectations for the response

1. Let's try generating a resonse from Microsoft Copilot using a prompt with a specific goal. In the chat box at the bottom of the Copilot pane, enter the following prompt:

    ```prompt
    I'm planning a trip to Paris in September. Can you help me?
    ```

1. Review the response from Copilot, which should ask for what specifics you would like to know.
 
1. Let's iterate based on previous prompts and responses to refine the result. Enter the following prompt:

    ```prompt
    Where's a good location in Paris to stay? 
    ```

1. Review the response, which should provide some specific places to stay in Paris.

1. Enter the following prompt: 

    ```prompt
    What are the top 10 sights to see do in Paris. Answer with a numbered list in order of popularity.
    ```

1. Review the response, which should provide a numbered list of sights to see in Paris.

1. Now, let's provide a source to ground the response in a specific scope of information. Enter the following: 
    
    ```prompt
    Based on the information at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Paris, what were the key events in the city's history?
    ```

1. Review the response, which should provide information based on the provided website. 

1. Now let's try to add context and set clear expectations. Enter the following prompt: 

    ```prompt
    What three places do you recommend I stay in Paris to be within walking distance to historical attractions? 
    ```

1. Review the response. Set clear expectations for the response by entering the following prompt: 

    ```prompt
    Explain your reasoning
    ```

1. Review the response. Notice that the response is able to build on the previous reponse and provide additional resources. 

1. When you are done, you can close the browser window.
