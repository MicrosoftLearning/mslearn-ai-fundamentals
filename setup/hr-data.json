      "content": "Contoso Corporation Paid Sick Leave Policy\n\nPurpose:\nContoso Corporation is committed to the health and well-being of our employees and their families. This paid sick leave policy provides employees with paid time off to recover from illness or injury, care for sick family members, or attend medical appointments.\n\nSick Leave Accrual:\nAll regular employees (full-time and part-time) accrue sick leave at the rate of 1 day per month, up to a maximum accrual of 60 days. Sick leave begins accruing on the first day of employment and is available for use immediately.\n\nPermitted Uses:\nSick leave may be used for:\n- Employee's own illness, injury, or medical condition\n- Medical, dental, or vision appointments for the employee\n- Care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent, sibling) who is ill or has a medical appointment\n- Care for a family member or household member as required by law\n- Circumstances arising from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking involving the employee or family member\n\nNotification Requirements:\nEmployees should notify their manager as soon as possible when they need to use sick leave, preferably before the start of their scheduled shift. For absences of 3 or more consecutive days, employees may be required to provide medical documentation.\n\nSick Leave vs PTO:\nSick leave is separate from PTO (vacation time). Employees should use sick leave for health-related absences and reserve PTO for vacation and personal time. However, employees may choose to use PTO for sick time if they prefer.\n\nCarryover:\nUnused sick leave carries over from year to year up to the maximum accrual of 60 days. There is no annual forfeiture of sick leave.\n\nPayout:\nSick leave is not paid out upon termination of employment. The purpose of sick leave is to provide income protection during illness, not as additional compensation.\n\nAbuse of Sick Leave:\nContoso expects employees to use sick leave appropriately. Patterns of abuse, such as frequent Monday or Friday absences or use of sick leave immediately after PTO requests are denied, may result in disciplinary action. Sick leave may not be used to extend vacation or for other non-health-related purposes.\n\nDisability Leave:\nFor serious health conditions requiring extended absence, employees should contact HR about short-term or long-term disability leave options, which may provide additional benefits beyond sick leave.\n\nQuestions:\nFor questions about sick leave, please contact HR at hr@contoso.com or 1-800-CONTOSO."
